# Obsidian Traffic lights
This repository is an Obsidian CSS Stylesheet that modifies the titlebar to look like the MacOS defaults.

### Instalation
Clone this repository into your vault and activate the css files in `Settings / Appearance`.

### Contribute
This repository might be expanded at a later date, but any updates in on a hiatus.

### Credits
If you want to use this to use this in your Obsidian project you could do this while mentioning me in the credits of your theme/extension/etc or try to reach out to me by creating an Issue.

### Plans
There aren't any updates planned.

If you look for a theme that adds libadwaita titlebar to Obsidian, you should use the [Obsidian's Adwaita Theme](https://github.com/birneee/obsidian-adwaita-theme) by Benedikt Spies.
